## What is M2TW Engine Overhaul Project?

M2TW Engine Overhaul Project is designed to expand the capabilities of the game *Medieval 2: Total War*.

## How does it work?

EOP uses C++ and Assembly to modify the game's code in-memory and exposes this to the end user via Lua scripts and the [EOP Lua Library](https://youneuoy.github.io/M2TWEOP-library/_static/LuaLib/index.html)

## Features

* Hugely expanded Lua scripting system that integrates seamlessly with existing campaign_script scripts, hot-reload, new custom console, debugger and much more
* Place .fbx models anywhere on the strategy map with full animation and texture support
* Play custom sounds or music with support for WAV, OGG/Vorbis and FLAC
* Unlocks all vanilla console commands
* Create your own GUIs and overlays using the popular [ImgGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* New custom EDU system that allows the creation and modification of new units without the need to restart the game
* Play out Hotseat battles online and transfer the results back to the campaign map
* Set your own limits for the number of religions, ancillaries, bodyguard units, building chains, max unit size
* Set the boundaries of the number of soldiers in units and the size of the battle map
* Fixed many engine bugs, crashes and oversights (e.g crashes when using berserkers in battle)
* Edit worldpkgdesc for any settlement on the fly without the need to restart the game
* Custom keybinding support
* Added ability to write your own add-ons in C++. The library exports many different functions.
* Many, many more

## Examples

### Removing engine limits
```lua
function onPluginLoad()
    M2TWEOP.unlockGameConsoleCommands();
    M2TWEOP.setAncillariesLimit(16);
    M2TWEOP.setMaxBgSize(100);
    M2TWEOP.setReligionsLimit(50);
    M2TWEOP.setBuildingChainLimit(40);
    M2TWEOP.setGuildCooldown(3);
end
```
### Playing sounds, displaying GUIs and spawning units
```lua
-- onGeneralAssaultsGeneral is a custom EOP event
function onGeneralAssaultsGeneral(attacker, defender)
        if(isNotNull(attacker)) then
            -- Check if the character is a Nazgul
            if(hasTrait(attacker, "NazgulRace")) then
                -- Play a sound
                playSound(nazgulScream);
                -- Display some text
                showWindow("The Nazgul have arrived.");
                -- Spawn a new unit
                spawnUnit('Gondor Infantry', 'Anorien' , 'Minas Tirith' ,3,4,1,1);
        end
    end
end
```

## Build

**Requirements**

M2TWEOP is developed in C++ and Assembly.

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/visualstudio2019community)
* DirectX SDK 2009 (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/directx-sdk)

Use Choco (https://chocolatey.org/install) for easy install.

**How to build**
1. Clone or download the project and extract it to a folder
2. Run Developer Powershell for Visual Studio 2019 in Admin mode
3. Navigate to where you have cloned/extracted the project
4. Run buildEOP.ps1

You can get support for building/developing on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Epqjm8u2WK) server.

## Support the project

It would be nice if all interested people supported the project in an accessible way (for example, you can test various changes, participate in planning new game mechanics or discuss them, sponsor development with money, etc.).
* Come join the our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Epqjm8u2WK) server if you have questions or suggestions.

With the help of this program, it will probably be possible someday to give modders the opportunity to change the MTW2 gameplay beyond recognition.

## Disclaimer

Please do not include the program in your modifications without my permission (and I will allow, if you ask). I just want to have some usage statistics.
